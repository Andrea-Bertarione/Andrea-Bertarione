# Hi there! I'm Berta 👋

### 🚀 About Me
I'm **Andrea Bertarione** (but most people call me **Berta**) - a 21-year-old backend developer and lifelong gamer from Turin, Italy. I craft digital solutions that blend code, creativity, and user-centered design.

My journey with code started **7 years ago** in high school when Minecraft modding sparked a real passion for building digital solutions. I began as a self-taught tinkerer and have grown through hands-on freelance gigs, challenging internships, and collaborations around the world.

🎓 **Currently:** Finishing my Computer Science degree at the University of Turin & providing Level 1 IT support  
🌱 **Learning:** Exploring Svelte and building more interactive web experiences  
🎮 **Fun fact:** When I'm not coding, you'll find me leading campaigns as a Dungeon Master or mapping out intricate worlds
